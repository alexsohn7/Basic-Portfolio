                <p> Hi everyone! I'm Alex Sohn.  I graduated from the University of California Riverside, and I currently work for a healthcare technology company located in Santa Monica as a data management intern.  I am very excited to embark on this journey in software development.  I find it rewarding 
                to express myself creatively through projects while also being analytical through problem solving.  I love the feeling of accomplishing complex tasks by breaking them down into smaller parts and architecturing them into something beautiful.  My hobbies include tennis, mixed martial arts, and public speaking. 
                </p>
